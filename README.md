# SnowSQL Scripts

This repository showcases a collection of SQL scripts authored by me, encompassing both original creations and utilized resources. It serves as a reference point linked to my portfolio website, highlighting my expertise and contributions in database management and querying.

## Helper

This section of the repository contains SQL codes that will help you with bit of a Data Engineering rather than Analysis. Examples presented in this sections are from real projects. 

### Creat Tasks
A task can execute any one of the following types of SQL code:

-**Single**: SQL statement

-**Call**: to a stored procedure

-**Procedural**: logic using Snowflake Scripting

Tasks can be combined with table streams for continuous ELT workflows to process recently changed table rows. Streams ensure exactly once semantics for new or changed data in a table.

Tasks can also be used independently to generate periodic reports by inserting or merging rows into a report table or perform other periodic work.
